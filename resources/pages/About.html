            <h2>About Mack</h2>
            
            <p>I’m an experienced Computer Science teacher. I joined the Dover CTC in 2015 and helped build and cultivate the computer programming career program. I had a hand in everything from designing the curriculum, the workspace when we got a new building, and an articulated agreement with Greatbay College ensuring running start credit for students. I actively use a variety of means to teach programming from robotics, physical programming, website design, app development, AP CS, 3d modelling and game design. I’m hoping for a new teaching adventure, maybe something closer to home!</p>
            <p>Thus I have taken the plunge and joined the White Mountain Regional Career Technical Career as it's new Computer Science Teacher. I'm looking forward to growing the classes and program along with engaging in some fun computer science projects!</p>
