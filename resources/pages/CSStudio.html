            <h2>CS Studio</h2>
            <p>Mobile applications are becoming increasingly important to our consumption of media, news, social interaction, and learning. In this course, students will learn how to create mobile apps using React Native, a popular platform-agnostic framework. As an online blended high school course, students will design and build applications to run on their own smartphones and will use the latest tools and technologies available for mobile app development. Students will complete a large end-of-course project where they will practice project development skills to create an app to solve a specific problem.</p>
            
            <p>Students learn how to create video games in JavaScript! While this course is introductory, it is an honors-level course. Its curriculum teaches the foundations of computer science and basic programming, with an emphasis on helping students develop logical thinking and problem solving skills. Once students complete the course, they will have learned material equivalent to a semester college introductory course in Computer Science and be able to program in JavaScript. The JavaScript course will provide the prerequisite information needed before students apply programming concepts to their physical Arduino device.</p>

            <p><strong>Learning Environment</strong></p>

            <p>The course utilizes a blended classroom approach. The content is fully web-based, with students writing and running code in the browser. Teachers utilize tools and resources provided by CodeHS to leverage time in the classroom and give focused 1-on-1 attention to students. Each unit of the course is broken down into lessons. Lessons consist of video tutorials, short quizzes, example programs to explore, and written programming exercises. All assignments will be online and easily accessible</p>
