            <h2>Lab Norms</h2>

            <p>These course’s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." These course’s
            recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of these course’s
            material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the
            work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.</p>
            <p>The essence of all work that you submit to these course’s must be your own. Collaboration on
            problems is not permitted (unless explicitly stated otherwise) except to the extent that you may
            ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your
            work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code or writing
            to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy’s other
            constraints.</p>
            <p>Collaboration on theses course’s Challenges or Labs is not permitted at all.</p>
            <p>Below are examples that inexhaustibly characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and
            not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit
            and receive approval in writing from your instructor. If a violation of this policy is suspected and
            confirmed, your instructor reserves the right to impose an appropriate penalty.</p>
            <p><strong>Reasonable</strong></p>
            <li>Communicating with classmates about problems</li>
            <li>Discussing these course's material with others in order to understand it better.</li>
            <li>Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code, such as by viewing, compiling, or
            running his or her code, even on your own computer.</li>
            <li>Incorporating snippets of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code,
            provided that those snippets are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that
            you cite the snippets' origins (as via comments in your code).</li>
            <li>Sending or showing code that you've written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he
            or she might help you identify and fix a bug.</li>
            <li>Sharing snippets of your own solutions to problems online so that others might help you
            identify and fix a bug or other issue.</li>
            <li>Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course's own, for references,
            and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problems.</li>
            <li>Whiteboarding solutions to problems with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not
            actual code.</li>
            <p><strong>Not Reasonable</strong></p>
            <li>Accessing a solution to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own.</li>
            <li>Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem before (re-)submitting your own.</li>
            <li>Decompiling, deobfuscating, or disassembling the sample solutions to problems available to you</li>
            <li>Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code, writing, or techniques that you
            discover outside of the course's own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while
            respecting this policy's other constraints.</li>
            <li>Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to a problem when it is he or she, and not you,
            who is struggling to solve it.</li>
            <li>Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your
            own.</li>
            <li>Providing or making available solutions to problems to individuals who might take this
            course in the future.</li>
            <li>Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problems online or elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Splitting a problem's workload with another individual and combining your work (unless
            explicitly authorized by the problem itself).</li>
            <li>Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond allowed
            snippets.</li>
            <li>Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to
            another.</li>
            <li>Viewing another's solution to a problem and basing your own solution on it.</li>

            <p><strong>Assessment</strong></p>
            <p>Because computer science is not a discipline that only lends itself to questions of right and wrong
              but also how and why, this course’s assessment policy is designed to try to answer some or all of
              these questions. The course’s problems are evaluated along two axes: correctness and style. Along with 
              the state-level Competencies, depending on the class</p>

              <table>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>Correctness</strong></td>
                  <td>To what extent is your submission consistent with our specification and free of bugs
                    or errors?</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>Style</strong></td>
                  <td>To what extent is your submission readable (i.e., code is commented and intended
                    with aptly named variables)?</td>
                </tr>
              </table>

              <p>To obtain a passing grade in the course, all students must ordinarily submit all assigned problems
                unless otherwise granted an exception in writing by the instructor</p>
  
              <p><strong>Food/Drink</strong></p>
              <p>Food and drinks are need permitted near the computer stations. There will be dedictated stations for water bottles or snacking.</p>

              <p><strong>Cellphone Policy</strong></p>
              <p>The CTC has a general no cellphones during instrcution time. This means your phone should not be visible during lecture, going over examples, group work. You will get <strong>one warning</strong> to put the phone away. If we are working on individual work you are welcome to <strong>ask to use your phone</strong>, if you don't ask permission you will get a warning. After the warning your phone will go into one of the phone jails and you can collect it at the end of the class.</p>
