            <h2>Lab Norms</h2>

            <p>These course’s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." These course’s
            recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of these course’s
            material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the
            work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.</p>
            <p>The essence of all work that you submit to these course’s must be your own. Collaboration on
            problems is not permitted (unless explicitly stated otherwise) except to the extent that you may
            ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your
            work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code or writing
            to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy’s other
            constraints.</p>
            <p>Collaboration on theses course’s Challenges or Labs is not permitted at all.</p>
            <p>Below are examples that inexhaustibly characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and
            not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit
            and receive approval in writing from your instructor. If a violation of this policy is suspected and
            confirmed, your instructor reserves the right to impose an appropriate penalty.</p>
            <p><strong>Reasonable</strong></p>
            <li>Communicating with classmates about problems</li>
            <li>Discussing these course's material with others in order to understand it better.</li>
            <li>Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code, such as by viewing, compiling, or
            running his or her code, even on your own computer.</li>
            <li>Incorporating snippets of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code,
            provided that those snippets are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that
            you cite the snippets' origins (as via comments in your code).</li>
            <li>Sending or showing code that you've written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he
            or she might help you identify and fix a bug.</li>
            <li>Sharing snippets of your own solutions to problems online so that others might help you
            identify and fix a bug or other issue.</li>
            <li>Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course's own, for references,
            and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problems.</li>
            <li>Whiteboarding solutions to problems with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not
            actual code.</li>

            <br>

            <p><strong>Not Reasonable</strong></p>
            <li>Accessing a solution to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own.</li>
            <li>Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem before (re-)submitting your own.</li>
            <li>Decompiling, deobfuscating, or disassembling the sample solutions to problems available to you</li>
            <li>Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code, writing, or techniques that you
            discover outside of the course's own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while
            respecting this policy's other constraints.</li>
            <li>Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to a problem when it is he or she, and not you,
            who is struggling to solve it.</li>
            <li>Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your
            own.</li>
            <li>Providing or making available solutions to problems to individuals who might take this
            course in the future.</li>
            <li>Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problems online or elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Splitting a problem's workload with another individual and combining your work (unless
            explicitly authorized by the problem itself).</li>
            <li>Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond allowed
            snippets.</li>
            <li>Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to
            another.</li>
            <li>Viewing another's solution to a problem and basing your own solution on it.</li>
            
            <br>

            <p><strong>Assessment</strong></p>
            <p>Because computer science is not a discipline that only lends itself to questions of right and wrong
              but also how and why, this course’s assessment policy is designed to try to answer some or all of
              these questions. The course’s problems are evaluated along two axes: correctness and style. Along with 
              the state-level Competencies, depending on the class</p>

              <table>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>Correctness</strong></td>
                  <td>This is the most important criterion. A program must meet its specifications (whether from a textbook problem or as written in the assignment) and function correctly. This means that it behaves as desired, producing the correct output, for a variety of inputs. This criterion includes the need to meet specifications by writing a program in a particular way or using a particular language feature, if such a thing is mentioned in the problem. If a specification is ambiguous or unclear, you have two choices: You can either make a reasonable assumption about what is required, based on what makes the most sense to you, or you can ask the instructor. If you make an assumption about an ambiguous specification, you should mention that somewhere in a comment so that the reader/grader knows what you were thinking. Points may be taken off for poor assumptions, however.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><strong>Readability</strong></td>
                  <td>Code needs to be readable to both you and a knowledgeable third party. This involves: - Using indentation consistently (e.g., every function's body is indented to the same level) - Adding white space (blank lines, spaces) where appropriate to help separate distinct parts of the code (e.g., space after commas in lists, blank lines between functions or between blocks of related lines within functions, etc.) - Giving variables meaningful names. Variables named A, B, and C or foo, bar, and baz give the reader no information whatsoever about their purpose or what information they may hold. Names like principal, maximum, and counter are much more useful. Loop variables are a common exception to this idea, and loop variables named i, j, etc. are okay. - The code should be well organized. Functions should be defined in one section of the program, code should be organized into functions so that blocks of code that need to be reused are contained within functions to enable that, and functions should have meaningful names.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Code Efficiency</td>
                  <td>There are often many ways to write a program that meets a particular specification, and several of them are often poor choices. They may be poor choices because they take many more lines of code (and thus your effort and time) than needed, or they may take much more of the computer's time to execute than needed. For example, a certain section of code can be executed ten times by copying and pasting it ten times in a row or by putting it in a simple for loop. The latter is far superior and greatly preferred, not only because it makes it faster to both write the code and read it later, but because it makes it easier for you to change and maintain</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Documentation</td>
                  <td>Every file containing code should start with a header comment. At the very least, this header should contain the name of the file, a description of what the included code does, and the name of its author (you). Other details you might include are the date it was written, a more detailed description of the approach used in the code if it is complex or may be misunderstood, or references to resources that you used to help you write it. All code should also be well-commented. This requires striking a balance between commenting everything, which adds a great deal of unneeded noise to the code, and commenting nothing, in which case the reader of the code (or you, when you come back to it later) has no assistance in understanding the more complex or less obvious sections of code. In general, aim to put a comment on any line of code that you might not understand yourself if you came back to it in a month without having thought about it in the interim</td>

              <p>To obtain a passing grade in the course, all students must ordinarily submit all assigned problems
                unless otherwise granted an exception in writing by the instructor</p>
  
              <br>

              <p><strong>Food/Drink</strong></p>
              <p>Food and drinks are need permitted near the computer stations. There will be dedictated stations for water bottles or snacking.</p>

              <p><strong>Electronic Devices</strong></p>
              <p> Phones and other electronic devices are allowed in class if they do not
                become a distraction (texting, playing games, checking social media, web browsing,
                etc.). Students who are regularly off task or behind in their work, will have their phone
                privileges revoked. However, during instructional time, tests and quizzes, electronic
                devices are not to be used at all (unless directed to by the teacher). 
                The CTC has a general no cellphones during instrcution time. This means your phone should not be visible during lecture, going over examples, group work. You will get <strong>one warning</strong> to put the phone away. If we are working on individual work you are welcome to <strong>ask to use your phone</strong>, if you don't ask permission you will get a warning. After the warning your phone will go into one of the phone jails and you can collect it at the end of the class.</p>
          
                <p><strong>Computer Use</strong></p>
                <p> The classroom computers and related devices are to be used for classwork
                  only. Do not download any files or programs not related to your classwork. Do not
                  change the Login screen background. Do not install any program without permission
                  of the teacher. Do not run any unapproved programs (Minecraft, Call of Duty, Halo,
                  etc.), even from a network or external drive. Do not view or download any images,
                  videos, or sound files that are offensive, racist, promote violence or drug use, etc. </p>
