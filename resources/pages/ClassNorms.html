            <h2>Lab Norms</h2>

            Your first and most important resource for help in learning the material in this course is your fellow students. 
            Starting on the first day of class, I encourage you to find a partner to work with. 
            <br>
            <br>

            With the obvious exception of your homework and exam, we encourage you to discuss all of the course activities with your friends and fellow students as you are working on them.
            You will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally on canvas. For your homework and exam, we expect you to hand in your own work. 
            Do not post your solutions on Canvas. The course staff works hard to put together this course, and we ask in return that you respect the integrity of the course by not misrepresenting your work.

            <h3>Class Attendance Policy</h3>
            Regular attendance is required.  Your presence in class is crucial since most of the activities in this course occur during class time.  Your active participation will enhance your success as well as that of your classmates.  Be active in class!  Participate in class discussions!  Your opinions, input, and questions are what this class is all about!  Class attendance is part of your work ethics grade. 
            <br><br>
            This policy includes Virtual or remote classes. Students are expected to show up and participate in Virtual sessions just like any other class.

            <h3>Late/Make Up Work</h3>
            Assignments are due on the announced due date by <strong>Midnight</strong>. It is your responsibility to keep up with class activities and assignments and request missing assignments due to absence.  Upon returning from an excused absence, students will be given two days for each day absence to make up missed assignments/test.  All students work at a different pace and will be graded primarily on their quality of work and productivity level during class.  As long as the students are highly productive each day and producing work of high quality, they will receive excellent grades.  Extensions will also be available upon request. 
            <br>

            <br>
            <h3>Food/Drink</h3>
            Food and drinks are not permitted near the computer stations. There will be dedicated stations for water bottles or snacking.
            <br>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h3>Electronic Devices</h3>
            Phones and other electronic devices are allowed in class if they do not become a distraction (texting, playing games, checking social media, web browsing, etc.). Students who are regularly off task or behind in their work, will have their phone privileges revoked. However, during instructional time, tests and quizzes, electronic devices are not to be used at all (unless directed to by the teacher). The CTC has a general no cellphones during instruction time policy. This means your phone should not be visible during lecture, going over examples, group work. You will get one warning to put the phone away. If we are working on individual work you are welcome to ask to use your phone, if you don't ask permission you will get a warning. After the warning your phone will go into one of the phone jails and you can collect it at the end of the class.

            <h3>Computer Use</h3>
            The classroom computers and related devices are to be used for classwork only. Do not download any files or programs not related to your classwork. Do not change the Login screen background. Do not install any program without permission of the teacher. Do not run any unapproved programs (Minecraft, Call of Duty, Halo, etc.), even from a network, external drive or remote device. Do not view or download any images, videos, or sound files that are offensive, racist, promote violence or drug use, etc.

            <h3>Students are expected...</h3>
            <li>To act in a manner that is respectful and courteous</li>
            <li>Show respect and courtesy for all class members and the teachers</li>
            <li>Disrespect WILL NOT be tolerated! </li>
            <li>Be prepared daily with all required materials</li>
            <li>Be punctual – be seated quietly and ready to begin when the bell rings</li>
            <li>Conduct yourself in a manner which respects all students’ right to learn</li>
            <li>Follow all verbal and written instructions from the teacher</li>
            <li>Use time between class to take care of restroom needs</li>
            <li>Stay in the room until the teacher dismisses class</li>
            <li>Contact teacher with any questions concerning a grade</li>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h3>Always Put Forth your Best Effort</h3>
            If a student produces sub par work but does so quickly to be ahead of the rest of the class, they will be expected to refine it until it is of high quality.  Completing work early for a lower grade is not an excuse for off task behavior.  Productivity points will be lost if such behavior is exhibited.  
            <br>
            <br>
            If work is completed early and of high quality, then the student may help assist other students while under the teacher's supervision or work on a more challenging extension project.
