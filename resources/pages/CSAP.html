            <p>AP Computer Science A introduces students to computer science through programming.
              Fundamental topics in this course include the design of solutions to problems, the use of data
              structures to organize large sets of data, the development and implementation of algorithms to
              process data and discover new information, the analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical
              and social implications of computing systems. The course emphasizes object-oriented
              programming and design using the Java programming language.</p>
            <p><strong>Learning Environment</strong></p>
            <p>The course utilizes a blended classroom approach. The content is fully web-based, with students
              writing and running code in the browser. Teachers utilize tools and resources provided by
              CodeHS to leverage time in the classroom and give focused 1-on-1 attention to students. Each
              unit of the course is broken down into lessons. Lessons consist of video tutorials, short quizzes,
              example programs to explore, and written programming exercises. All assignments will be online and easily accessible</p>
