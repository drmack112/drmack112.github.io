            <h2>Game Design</h2>
            <p>The global media and entertainment industry is complex, expansive, and rapidly evolving. Within it, two highly creative, increasingly lucrative fields have emerged that are capturing the hearts and minds of millions: interactive applications and video game creation. Students taking the course will design, develop, and deploy an original application or game. Students will learn to write and maintain a large, living game design document (GDD) and a daily design journal. Students might gain introductory artistic skills to 3D Modeling and Texturing using Maya if time permit</p>
            <p>This is my first attempt at a 3D game design curriculum, as such I will be using established lesson and resources from Unity. Students will work through the Create with Code course throught Unity. It's a free course with helpful videos and walk throughs of different projects. Students will also get the change to experience the Design Process and plan their on 3D game and make it as a final for the class, which they will present Game trail style to the class!</p>

                <td>This project is meant to be a challenge that touches multiple concepts from the course to produce a digital artifact. In this project, students will be developing their first digital artifact: a detailed document describing the creation of a game! Through the design process students will test and improve their design while updating their game design document nearly daily. Students will learn how to create a game level in a group and how to plan out a game.

            <h2>Learning Learning Outcomes</h2>
            <li><strong>PC. 1: Students will have programming knowledge skills that allow students to develop solutions to novel problems.</strong></li>
              <ul> 
                <li>EU 1.1 Programs can be developed for creative expression, to satisfy personal curiosity, to create new knowledge, or to solve problems (to help people, organizations, or society).</li>
                <li>EU 1.2 People write programs to execute algorithms.</li>
                <li>EU 1.3 Programming is facilitated by appropriate abstractions.</li>
                <li>EU 1.4 Programs are developed, maintained, and used by people for different purposes.</li>
                <li>EU 1.5 A variety of abstractions built on binary sequences can be used to represent all digital data.</li>
                <li>EU 1.6 Multiple levels of abstraction are used to write programs or create other computational artifacts.</li>
                <li>EU 1.7 Computing facilitates exploration and the discovery of connections in information.</li>
                <li>EU 1.8 There are trade-offs when representing information as digital data.</li>
              </ul>
            <li><strong>PC. 3: Students will effectively design and communicate to be contributing team members</strong></li>
              <ul> 
                <li>EU 3.1 Creative development can be an essential process for creating computational artifacts.</li>
                <li>EU 3.2 Computing enables people to use creative development processes to create computational artifacts for creative expression or to solve a problem.</li>
                <li>EU 3.3 Computing can extend traditional forms of human expression and experience.</li>
                <li>EU 3.4 Incorporating multiple perspectives through collaboration improves computing innovations as they are developed.</li>
                <li>EU 3.5 Developers create and innovate using an iterative design process that is user-focused, that incorporates implementation/feedback cycles, and that leaves ample room for experimentation and risk-taking.</li>
