            <h2>Web Design</h2>
            <p>The Web Development capstone course is intended to teach students the fundamentals of web development in a project-based learning environment. Students will be taught the basic elements of web development, such as web hosting, file organization, and incorporating Javascript into HTML files. Over the course of the school year, students will collaboratively and independently design, develop and implement functional and responsive web pages using these foundational skills.</p>
