            <h2>Web Design</h2>
            <p>The Web Development capstone course is intended to teach students the fundamentals of web development in a project-based learning environment. Students will be taught the basic elements of web development, such as web hosting, file organization, and incorporating Javascript into HTML files. Over the course of the school year, students will collaboratively and independently design, develop and implement functional and responsive web pages using these foundational skills.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Learning Environment</strong></p>

            <p>The course utilizes a blended classroom approach. The content is fully web-based, with students writing and running code in the browser. Teachers utilize tools and resources provided by CodeHS to leverage time in the classroom and give focused 1-on-1 attention to students. Each unit of the course is broken down into lessons. Lessons consist of video tutorials, short quizzes, example programs to explore, and written programming exercises. All assignments will be online and easily accessible</p>

                <td>This project is meant to be a challenge that touches multiple concepts from the course to produce a digital artifact. In this project, students will be developing their first digital artifact: their very own website! This website will start off as their own personal portfolio page, and as students progress through the course, they will keep adding links to their favorite projects. By the end of the course thie portfolio will serve as a way for students to showcase their work!

Students will use these concepts to evaluate the quality of formatted resumes. Students will draft their own interactive resume and make changes based on constructive feedback and link to their portfolio page.

Cybersecurity is a field that involves several disciplines of computer science. It is valuable to build basic computer science literacy no matter what field you eventually enter. Now that students have learned about digital citizenship and cyber hygiene, they will take what they have learned and create a PSA to inform members in the community about a topic!
