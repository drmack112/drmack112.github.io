            <h2>Web Design</h2>
            <p>The Web Development capstone course is intended to teach students the fundamentals of web development in a project-based learning environment. Students will be taught the basic elements of web development, such as web hosting, file organization, and incorporating Javascript into HTML files. Over the course of the school year, students will collaboratively and independently design, develop and implement functional and responsive web pages using these foundational skills.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Learning Environment</strong></p>

            <p>The course utilizes a blended classroom approach. The content is fully web-based, with students writing and running code in the browser. Teachers utilize tools and resources provided by CodeHS to leverage time in the classroom and give focused 1-on-1 attention to students. Each unit of the course is broken down into lessons. Lessons consist of video tutorials, short quizzes, example programs to explore, and written programming exercises. All assignments will be online and easily accessible</p>
