                  <p>The global media and entertainment industry is complex, expansive, and rapidly evolving. Within it, two highly creative, increasingly lucrative fields have emerged that are capturing the hearts and minds of millions: interactive applications and video game creation. Students taking the course will design, develop, and deploy an original application or game. Students will learn to write and maintain a large, living game design document (GDD) and a daily design journal. Students will gain introductory artistic skills to 3D Modeling and Texturing using 3DS Max and Photoshop.</p>

                  <p>Prerequisite: None</p>
                  <p>Computer Science App and Web Design is designed to introduce students to the breadth of the field of computer science through an exploration of mobile App creation and Web Design, through learning HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The course is designed to focus on the conceptual ideas of computing and help students understand why certain tools or languages might be utilized to solve particular problems. The goal of CS App and Web Design is to develop the computational thinking practices of algorithm development, problem solving and programming within the context of problems that are relevant to the lives of todayâ€™s students. Students will also be introduced to topics such as interface design, limits of computers and societal
                    and ethical issues. This is a competency-based course that is recommended for students pursuing a focus in programming.
