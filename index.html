            <h2>Why learn Programming?</h2>

            1. Programming is basic literacy: 'In the future, the amount of technology and our reliance on it will only increase. The students of today need to be able to understand and control it.'<br>
            2. It's a way to create change: 'In order to make change, the younger generations need to learn how to code.'<br>
            3. "You have an idea for the next big tech innovation? Great. Can you bring it to life?": 'What separated those who simply have an idea and those who make their ideas a reality is simple: the ability to code.'<br>
            4. Programming isn't that hard to learn: 'Learning how to program is like learning any other language. The difference is that programming can be much more powerful.'<br>
